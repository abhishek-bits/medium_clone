# Notes

Previously we had modules and components. That is why:
    - `app.component.ts`
    - `app.module.ts`

and if we are creating some feature, then we had to create another module example and register separate components.

Now, Angular **Standalone components** were introduced. Thus, ng-modules are now optional which means we can create new features just with components without using modules. This requires much less code to create new features.
